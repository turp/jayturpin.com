I've been practicing test driven developement, or TDD, since 2002. I'm not perfect, and I don't do it all the time, but I got pretty comfortable with it in C#. [NUnit](http://nuit.org) and MsTest are well integrated with Visual Studio, which made it easy to integrate into the workflow of the team.

In 2012, we started using Javascript, and once we realized we didn't understad how to write code in an idiomatic way, we switched to [Typescript](http://typesecriptlang.org). We quickly started investigating ways to write tests.

 This is a attempt to share what we've learned about the testing Typescript. In a series of blog posts, we will cover:
 
 * [Getting Started - Setting up the environment](testing_typescript_setup_env.html)
 * Unit Testing using Jasmine
 * Running Tests from command line
 * Testing AngualrJs - testing controllers
 * Testing AngualrJs - testing directives
 * Testing AngualrJs - testing services
