For many years, I have used podcasts to learn about new technologies. I listen to them during my commute, while working out and even while doing work around the house.

These are some of my favorites:

[Hanselminutes](http://hanselminutes.com) – Scott Hanselman is my top pick for podcast and [blog](http://hanselman.com). He is smart, witty and keeps his podcast fluff-free. With 400-plus episodes, there is lots of great content about .Net, Javascript, agile development. He interviews lots of interesting people, like [Martin Fowler](http://www.martinfowler.com), [Robert C "Uncle Bob" Martin](http://http://blog.cleancoder.com/) and others
 
[DotNet Rocks](http://dotnetrocks.com) – with over 1000 episodes, this podcast covered topic all over the programming world. And for the non-programmer, they have a series of geek out
 
·       HerdingCode.com – most coding, some agile topics
 
·       Freakonomics – economics – not agile at all
 
·       Dan Carlin’s Hardcore History – if you’re a history buff
