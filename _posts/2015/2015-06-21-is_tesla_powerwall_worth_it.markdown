I was listening to the [Energy Storage Geek Out](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=1154) episode on [dotnetrocks.com](http://www.dotnetrocks.com) and they were talking about the new [Tesla Powerwall](http://www.teslamotors.com/powerwall). I really love this concept - charge the battery at night when electricity is cheap and then use the power from the battery during peak hours when electricity is expensive. Brilliant! 

But it got me wondering: does it make financial sense? So I pulled out my calculator and crunched some numbers.

Here are my assumptions (which could all be wrong, so make sure you do your own homework):

* The daily-use Powerwall can provide 7kWh per day and costs about $3000 (plus installation). 
* According to the podcast, the unit is designed to be used for 5000 days (a little over 13 years) before it starts to degrade.

## In Phoenix

I live in the Phoenix area and most people here use a time-of-use plan. So that means, in June, we pay about 7 cents a kWh during the evenings and about 19 cents during the middle of the day. That means if I use the [Tesla Powerwall](http://www.teslamotors.com/powerwall), I can use 7 kWh of electricity during the heat of the day. Since I charge the battery in the evening, I only paid 49 cents instead of almost $1.40, saving me 84 cents per day (7kWh x 12 cents = 84 cents)

Now we have different rates during each season, so I applied this logic for an entire year:


Season  | Hi/Low Diff  | Days | Savings/Day | Savings/Year
------  | -----------: | ---: | ----------: | -----------:
Nov-Apr | 0.0309       | 180  | 0.2163      |  38.934
May-Jun | 0.1219       |  61  | 0.8533      |  52.0513
Jul-Aug | 0.1485       |  62  |	1.0395      |  64.449
Sep-Oct | 0.1219       |  61  |	0.8533      |  52.0513
Total   |              |      |             | 207.4856

So, by my calculation, with a savings of $207/year, it will take 14.5 years to recoup the initial investment of $3000. Bummer.

## Los Angeles

I wanted to get at least one more data point, so I looked up time-of-use rates from [Los Angeles Department of Water and Power](https://ladwp.com/ladwp/faces/ladwp/aboutus/a-financesandreports/a-fr-electricrates/a-fr-er-electricrateschedules). As near as I determine from their site, it looks like it will take even longer to recoup the cost

Season  | Hi/Low Diff  | Days | Savings/Day | Savings/Year
------  | -----------: | ---: | ----------: | -----------:
Jun-Sep | 0.08 	       | 122  | 0.56        |  68.32
Oct-May | 0.01 	       | 243  | 0.07        |  17.01
Total   |              |      |             |  85.33


Over 35 years to get your money back.

## Conclusion

Perhaps if I had solar panels on my roof, this might make more sense. I'm not sure what the trade-off is for storing power in a battery compared to selling it back to the grid. Maybe in other area, where the difference between peak and off-peak rates is greater, it would also make more sense.

But until the prices come down for this technology, it doesn't make financial sense for me.
