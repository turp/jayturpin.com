## Contributors

Being a mentor or inspiration is largely a thankless job: your thoughts, ideas and suggestions are given out freely and incorporated into the lives and work habits of the people that listened. Sometimes they remember it was your idea. Other times, they forget where the wisdom came from (but it transformed their lives). And sometimes they completely forget that the idea came from anywhere but their own mind.  

So, before I go any further, I want to thank all of those people who have helped along in my journey as a software developer. Your collective guidance has helped me get where I am today. Thanks you!

Even though I don't remember everyone that has influenced me over the years, I do want to call out a few people whom I do remember: 

* **Kent Beck** - The creator of eXtreme Programming. A developer's developer. Kent inspired a generation of software professionals to see the world a different way. He convinced us that clean code was important. Testing is important. Being craft-dudes and -dudettes is important. He fundamentally changed the way the I write software and I am forever grateful. 
* Martin Fowler 
* Ron Jeffries
* Robert C. "Uncle Bob" Martin
* DHH
* Why The Lucky Stiff
* Scott Hanselman
* Phil Haack
* Joel Spolsky
* Kathy Sierra
* Gina Tripani
* Jeff Atwood
* Rob Conery
* The Prags

I sure there are others that I am forgetting, and for that, I am sorry.
